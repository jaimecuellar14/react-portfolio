                Within my 3 years of experience working in Netkia
                I were part of different mobile app projects.
                
                During this period of time I worked with:
                <ul>
                    <li>AngularJS</li>
                    <li>PHP Slim</li>
                    <li>Cordova</li>
                    <li>Gulp</li>
                    <li>Xamarin Forms</li>
                    <li>SQL</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}
